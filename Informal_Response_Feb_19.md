### New filters 
```
filter = [ [0,1,0], [1,-4, 1], [0,1,0]]
```
This is the image after applying the first filter.

The filter seems to emphasize more on the horizontal lines compared with the original image. 

```
filter = [[-1, -2, -1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 1]]
```

This the image after applying the second filter. 
![image_filter1](IR3_Filter2.png)

The filter seems to emphasize more on the vertical lines compared with the original image. 

```
filter = [[4,2,1],[2,0,-1],[1,2,0]]
```

This the image after applying the third filter.

The filter creates a high exposure effect, which makes the entire image looks a lot brighter. 

### What are you functionally accomplishing as you apply the filter to your original array?

### Why is the application of a convolving filter to an image useful for computer vision?
