# Machine Learning Lesson 2 - Computer Vision

### The purpose of splitting training set and testing set
To train the neural network, we need data and labeled images. There are two sets of data, training set and testing set, which are consists of images and labels in each set. The main reason of splitting the data into two is to train the neural network with a unfamiliar assessment. By teaching the neural network with a massive set of training images, we need to test the neural network by providing another new set of testing images that is return with a predicted label. Now, we can test the effectiveness of the training by examining the prediction by the trained model.
