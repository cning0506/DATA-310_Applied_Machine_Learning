## Slice of Data Science - Emilio Luz-Ricca (Sophomore at College of W&M)
### March.11.2021

This week's Slice of Data Science, we have Emilio Luz-Ricca, who is a sophomore at W&M. I recalled taking the same Econometrics course last semester. 
I think he is extremely capable and he is very good at what he is doing. The topic is making cleaner and more accessible visualizations in R. He explains his reasons for choosing R which are reproducibility and transparency.
Specifically, he focuses on the tidyverse package. Tidyverse is used for data wrangling and plotting. 

He provided an example of Education expenditure over years for three nations, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany.
He went over the plot steps by steps. He add elements gradually. He first remove the x label, then remove legend and add text
for eeach country. He emphasizes on the thematic color for each nation as well. Overall, I really like his advice on recreating plots that we like as a good way to practice R.
