### Due Date: 5/18/2021 5:00PM

## Abstract 
With the more advanced knowledge on Machine learning techniques, there is a boundless amount of applications with the help of Tensorflow Package, a mainstream Machine Learning Package for Python users. With the ability to predict and evaluate the "reasonable" values, we want to take an overview of the landscape of Startups and explore the key factors of a Startup to succeed in California.    

## Data Description
With the dataset that I collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/manishkc06/startup-success-prediction), we are looking at the in-depth profile of 923 startups in the United States. To narrow the scope of the investigation, we will only be analyzing the startups in California, which is accounted for more than half (53%) of the dataset. There are 48 features/columns in this data, we will only be focusing on several quantiative features and a few categorical features as well. 

## Problem Statement 
Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, all these Big-Tech companies today have been through the stage of Startup, which describes the young, rising companies that have started from Zero to One. The First Pot of Gold from a Venture Capitalist and any investor is usually the priority of a Startup.
