## Question 1
##### In Laurence Maroneyâ€™s video, What is ML, he compares traditional programming with machine learning and argues that the main difference between the two is a reorientation of the rules, data and answers. According to Maroney, what is the difference between traditional programming and machine learning?
My Response: 
When it comes to traditional programming, the rules and data are the input or the materials that leads to the traditional programming. As an output, we get the answer. On the other hand, the answers and the data that are processed with labeling are the input, followed by the training of neural network/neurons. Finally, we will get the rules as the output. 

## Question 2 
##### With the first basic script that Maroney used to predict a value output from the model he estimated (he initially started with 10 that predicted ~31. Modify the predict function to produce the output for the value 7. Do this twice and provide both answers. Are they the same? Are they different? Why is this so?
My Response: 
Trial 1 - 21.999985 Trial 2 - 21.999985. They are the same. I think they are the same because I am 

## Question 3
##### Using the script you produced to predict housing price, take the provided six houses from Mathews, Virginia and train a neural net model that estimates the relationship between them. Based on this model, which of the six homes present a good deal? Which one is the worst deal? Justify your answer.
