## Mini Project 1 (Feb.14)
-Was your social distance detector effective at detecting potential violations? 
-Are you able to describe how the distance detector is applying its calculations of either being safe or noting a violation?
-Do you think this approach would be effective for estimating new infections in real time? How would you implement such an approach in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we are currently experiencing?
What limitations or improvements might you include in order to improve your proposed design?
