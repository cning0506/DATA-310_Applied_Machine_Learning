## Mini Project 1 (Feb.14)


### - Was your social distance detector effective at detecting potential violations? 

### - Are you able to describe how the distance detector is applying its calculations of either being safe or noting a violation?

### - Do you think this approach would be effective for estimating new infections in real time? How would you implement such an approach in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we are currently experiencing?
I don't think this detector model would be that effective. With the current efficiency of the algorithm, it will require a massive amount of time to run the prediction. The time might be reduced if I have access to computers with better hardware. In general, I think this is a good method to help evaluate the risk level in different regions, especially the ones with higher population density. 

### - What limitations or improvements might you include in order to improve your proposed design?
